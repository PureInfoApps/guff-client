# Contributing to Guff

Thank you for considering contributing to Guff! We appreciate your interest and support. 

To contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:

## Code of Conduct

Please review and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a positive and inclusive community.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository including dev branch.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies.
- Create a new branch for your changes with dev branch as base.
- Make your modifications or add new features.
- Write tests for your changes (if applicable).
- Ensure that your code follows the project's coding conventions and [style guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md).
- Commit your changes with a descriptive and small commit message (if possible around 60 characters or less).
- Push your branch to your forked repository.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository dev branch.

## Issue Tracker

Before starting to work on a new feature or bug fix, please check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/PureInfoApps/guff-client/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported or if someone else is already working on it.

If you find a bug or have a feature request that hasn't been reported, please open a new issue, providing as much detail as possible.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, please ensure the following:

- Provide a clear and descriptive title (if possible around 60 characters or less) for your pull request.
- Include a descreptive summary of the changes made.
- Reference the relevant issue(s) if applicable.
- Make sure your code passes all tests (if applicable).
- Keep your pull request focused on a single feature or bug fix.
- Be responsive to any feedback or questions during the review process.

When accepting a pull request, please ensure the following:

- Review the changes made in the pull request thoroughly.
- Test the changes locally to ensure they function as intended.
- Communicate and collaborate with the contributor if further changes or discussions are needed.
- Update the pull request title if required to denote type in [] at start like [Fix].
- Try using emojis in title:
  - Features:‚ú®, Bug Fixes:üêõ, Performance:‚ö°, Code Analysis:üîç, Refactoring:‚ôªÔ∏è, Code Cleanup:üßπ, Adding New Files:üìù (for documents)üñºÔ∏è (for image or asset files) üìÅ (for folders) üóÇÔ∏è (for organization or structure changes), etc.
- (IMP) Use Squash + Merge to avoid cluttering commit history in dev and main branch. Squash + Merge acts like merge but creates a single new squashed commit that encompasses all commits in the feature branch.
- Include proper description of all changes in the new Squash commit description.
- Avoid doing Squash + Merge for pull requests containing large changes.
- Avoid doing Rebase if you are not expierneced with it.
