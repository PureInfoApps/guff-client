## Comments

- Use comments to explain logic and decisions.
- Update or remove outdated comments as code evolves.

## Documentation

- Document public APIs, interfaces, and important modules/classes.
- Use clear and concise language in your documentation.
- Provide examples and usage instructions when appropriate.
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.

## Testing

- Use descriptive test names that clearly express the expected behavior.

## Additional Note

There is no fixed list of rules in the style guide of this project. While we have provided some guidelines here, we understand that every project has its unique requirements and conventions. If there is a need for additional changes or adaptations to the guidelines mentioned above, we will communicate them to you.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our codebase is consistent, maintainable, and well-documented. Remember to prioritize readability and clarity when writing code and documentation.
